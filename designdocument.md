# Rowan Lowden's Personal Website Design Document

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create myself a personal website to communicate my background, interests, technology skills, personal coding projects, and contact information. The goal is a simple, yet fun design that is visually appealing to visitors, user friendly, and adaptable to various devices. It is built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, and JavaScript, the homepage presents clear and organized information, catering to students, industry professionals, and potential collaborators.


I plan on having 3 HTML pages: 
- Homepage with an avatar of myself, a brief welcome message, a list of skills, and a contact form at the bottom. 
- About Page with A longer about me, education, and hobbies
- The third page Projects highightly 4 recent personal projects from the last year with titles, images, tech used, and link to github repos.

Each page will have the same header and footer. They will include:
- The header will have my full name of the left and a navigation bar on the right (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
- The footer will have 3 links to (github, linkedin, and social media), copyright in the middle, and a back to top button on the right. 

A key feature that differentiaties my homepage from others is... ?? I do want to do the winky face.
I need probably another key feature
