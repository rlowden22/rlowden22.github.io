## Use of AI 
As per the assignment, one page is created using AI, the projects page.  

I used the following prompt while also submitting a screenshot of the original design: "prompt"

Please help me put together the html and CSS for my projects page. I already inserted the header and footer I wrote for the first two pages. I want the projects page to be simple, a grid layout with two columns and two rows to show 4 projects. Each card will have the project title, an image of it, a short description, the tech stack listed, and a link to the github repo as the github icon.
