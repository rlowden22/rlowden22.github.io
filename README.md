## Use of AI

As per the assignment, the code for one page is created using AI, its the Projects page. I used the following prompt while also submitting a screenshot of the original design:

"Please help me put together the html and CSS for my projects page. I already inserted the header and footer I wrote for the first two pages. I want the projects page to be simple, a grid layout with two columns and two rows to show 4 projects. Each card will have the project title, an image of it, a short description, the tech stack listed, and a link to the github repo as the github icon."

For the most part it worked, I adjusted the picture size, the fit of the picture, updated the link to a github logo, changed the colors, added my pictures, etc.

I also used AI to help me better understand the eslint configuration, how to intall and run ESLint, and write this readme.
